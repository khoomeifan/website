    <p><strong><span style="font-size:20px">Shawn Zheng</span></strong> is a Chinese-American hornist who enjoys a varied career as an orchestral and chamber musician, and educator.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>He was a National YoungArts Foundation Winner, candidate for the Presidential Scholar in the Arts, 
    and made his solo concerto debut with “The President’s Own” U.S. Marine Band as the winner of its solo competition. 
    He has also been a prizewinner of the Nashville Symphony Concerto Competition, Curb Youth Symphony Competition, 
    and Southeast Horn Symposium Competition. 
    He is a regular guest musician with the Houston Symphony and Houston Ballet Orchestra, among others. 
    His broad musical interests have brought him to perform in Rice’s new music ensemble Hear&Now, 
    as part of the Ziering-Conlon Initiative for Recovered Voices, 
    in which he performed several programs featuring music by composers whose lives were disrupted during the years of the Nazi regime, 
    and as a recurring guest artist with the Colburn Chamber Music Society. 
    In previous summers, he has been a Fellow of the National Orchestral Institute, the Sarasota Music Festival, and the National Youth Orchestra, performing in Carnegie Hall and across Latin America. 
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A devoted educator and proponent of community engagement, he has taught sectionals for the Colburn Community School and Jumpstart Young Musician’s Program, 
    a tuition-free program that provides opportunities for low-income Los Angeles-area students. 
    He was also a contributor to Rice University’s Just For U Music Program (JUMP!), 
    a student-led initiative that produces educational performances for Houston students. D
    uring the pandemic, Shawn founded and directed the Hanszen Chamber Music Festival, a genre-spanning concert series that sought to create valuable concertizing experiences for both performers and audiences.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>He received his Bachelor of Music from Rice University’s Shepherd School of Music, where he studied with William VerMeulen, 
    and is currently in the Professional Studies Certificate program at the Colburn School, 
    studying with Andrew Bain. Born and raised in Tennessee, he has also studied with 
    Leslie Norton at Vanderbilt University’s Blair Academy, and attended the Interlochen Arts Academy, 
    where he studied with Corbin Wagner. In his free time, he enjoys reading non-fiction, weight training, and learning about art history.</p>
