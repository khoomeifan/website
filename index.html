   <p><strong><span style="font-size:20px">Shawn Zheng</span></strong> is a Washington, D.C.-based hornist who enjoys a diverse career as an orchestral and chamber musician, soloist, and educator. He currently serves as a member of "The President's Own" U.S. Marine Band.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>He was a National YoungArts Foundation Winner, prizewinner of the Nashville Symphony Concerto Competition, Curb Youth Symphony Competition, and Southeast Horn Symposium Competition, and made his solo concerto debut with “The President’s Own” as the winner of its high school concerto competition. 
    He is a regular guest musician with the Houston Symphony and Houston Ballet Orchestra, among others. 
    His broad musical interests have brought him to perform in Rice’s new music ensemble Hear&Now, 
    as part of the Ziering-Conlon Initiative for Recovered Voices, featuring music by composers whose lives were disrupted during the years of the Nazi regime, 
    and as a recurring guest artist with the Colburn Chamber Music Society. 
    In previous summers, he was a Fellow of the National Orchestral Institute, the Sarasota Music Festival, and the National Youth Orchestra, performing in Carnegie Hall, at the Tanglewood Music Festival, and across Latin America. 
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A devoted educator and proponent of community engagement, he has taught for the Colburn Community School and Jumpstart Young Musician’s Program, 
    a tuition-free program that provides opportunities for low-income Los Angeles-area students. 
    He was also a contributor to Rice University’s Just For U Music Program (JUMP!), 
    a student-led initiative that produces educational performances for Houston students. During the pandemic, Shawn founded and directed the Hanszen Chamber Music Festival, a genre-spanning concert series that sought to create valuable concertizing experiences for both performers and audiences.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>He received his Bachelor of Music from Rice University’s Shepherd School of Music, where he studied with William VerMeulen, and pursued the post-graduate Professional Studies Certificate at the Colburn School, studying with Andrew Bain. He is also grateful for numerous other mentors, including Leslie Norton at Vanderbilt University’s Blair Academy, and Corbin Wagner at the Interlochen Arts Academy.</p>
