        <h2 class="post-title">On the Art of Listening</h2>
        <div class="post-date">November 15, 2024</div>
        <div class="post-content">
            <p>In a world that grows increasingly louder, the art of listening becomes more precious. As musicians, we understand that silence is not the absence of sound, but the presence of attention. Every note exists in relationship to the silence that surrounds it.</p>
            
            <p>I've been thinking about this lately, especially during rehearsals with the Marine Band. The way we listen to each other—not just to our own parts, but to the whole—creates something larger than the sum of its parts. It's a conversation where every voice matters, where the slightest dynamic shift can change the entire meaning of a phrase.</p>
            
            <p>This extends beyond music, of course. In teaching, I've learned that the most important skill isn't speaking, but listening. Really hearing what a student is trying to express, even when they don't yet have the technical ability to express it clearly. The breakthrough moments come not from correction, but from understanding.</p>

        <h2 class="post-title">The Weight of Tradition</h2>
        <div class="post-date">October 28, 2024</div>
        <div class="post-content">
            <p>There's something profound about playing music that was written centuries before you were born. Every time I pick up the horn to play Mozart or Brahms, I'm participating in a conversation that spans generations. The same notes that moved audiences in Vienna still have the power to stop time today.</p>
            
            <p>But tradition isn't just preservation—it's transformation. Each performance is both an act of fidelity and an act of creation. We honor the past while speaking to the present. The challenge is finding your own voice within the established forms, adding your own color to the palette without breaking the frame.</p>
            
            <p>I think about this often when working with young musicians. How do we teach them to respect the tradition while encouraging them to find their own musical identity? It's a delicate balance between discipline and freedom, between what was and what could be.</p>

        <h2 class="post-title">Small Moments, Large Meanings</h2>
        <div class="post-date">September 12, 2024</div>
        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Yesterday, after a particularly challenging rehearsal, a colleague mentioned how a single phrase I played had given them chills. It was a simple passage, nothing technically demanding, but something about the way the air moved through the instrument in that moment created magic.</p>
            
            <p>These are the moments that remind me why we do this work. Not for the applause or the accolades, but for those fleeting instances when music becomes more than sound—when it becomes meaning. When the boundary between performer and listener dissolves, and we're all just human beings sharing in something beautiful.</p>
            
            <p>I've been collecting these moments, mentally, like pressed flowers in a book. They sustain me through the long hours of practice, the technical challenges, the inevitable frustrations. They remind me that music is not just what we do, but who we are.</p>
